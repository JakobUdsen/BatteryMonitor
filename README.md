# BatteryMonitor
Arduino program to monitor battery status

To monitor battery health and track the remaining charge in a 48V battery pack composed of 4 x 12V, 100Ah batteries in series, you could write a program that periodically measures and records the following values:

Voltage: The voltage of each battery and the overall voltage of the battery pack.

Current: The current flowing into and out of the battery pack.

Temperature: The temperature of each battery and the battery pack as a whole.

State of Charge (SOC): The percentage of the battery capacity that has been used. This can be calculated by comparing the current voltage and capacity of the battery to its fully charged voltage and capacity.

Capacity: The total capacity of the battery pack and the remaining capacity.

Time: The time elapsed since the battery pack was last charged and the time remaining until the battery pack is fully discharged.

Based on these values, you can create an algorithm to determine the battery health, remaining charge, and predict the remaining life of the battery pack.

Here's a high-level framework of the program:

Initialization: Set up the voltage and current sensor, shunt resistor, and any other necessary components.

Read Values: Continuously read the voltage, current, temperature, and time values.

Calculate SOC: Use the voltage and capacity of the battery to calculate the state of charge (SOC).

Calculate Remaining Capacity: Use the current and time values to calculate the remaining capacity of the battery pack.

Determine Health: Use the voltage, current, temperature, and SOC values to determine the health of the battery pack and each individual battery.

Display or Log Data: Display the values on an LCD screen or save the data to a file for later analysis.

Note that the specific algorithm used to determine battery health and predict the remaining life may vary based on the type of battery (AGM lead-acid, Gel, LiFePo4, etc.) and the specific requirements of your application.


To output the battery health data and store a log on an SD card, you could modify the program as follows:

Initialization: Set up the voltage and current sensor, shunt resistor, CAN-bus, and SD card.

Read Values: Continuously read the voltage, current, temperature, and time values.

Calculate SOC: Use the voltage and capacity of the battery to calculate the state of charge (SOC).

Calculate Remaining Capacity: Use the current and time values to calculate the remaining capacity of the battery pack.

Determine Health: Use the voltage, current, temperature, and SOC values to determine the health of the battery pack and each individual battery.

Output Data: Package the data in a CAN-bus message and transmit it every second.

Store Log: Save the data to an SD card as a log for later analysis.

In this setup, the battery health data is transmitted on the CAN-bus every second for real-time monitoring, and a log of the data is also stored on the SD card for later analysis.

You may consider using a library or API that provides support for CAN-bus communication and SD card storage, such as the CANBUS library for CAN-bus communication and the SD library for SD card storage.




To store the configuration information for the battery health monitoring system and keep an event log with timestamps, you could add the following steps to the program:

Initialization: Set up the voltage and current sensor, shunt resistor, CAN-bus, SD card, and RTC module.

Read Configuration: Check if a configuration file exists on the SD card and read the information if it does. If no configuration file exists, prompt the user to enter the necessary information, such as battery type, voltage, Ah capacity, number of batteries in the pack, log intervals, CAN-bus transmit ID, and transmission intervals.

Write Configuration: Store the configuration information in a file on the SD card.

Read Values: Continuously read the voltage, current, temperature, and time values.

Calculate SOC: Use the voltage and capacity of the battery to calculate the state of charge (SOC).

Calculate Remaining Capacity: Use the current and time values to calculate the remaining capacity of the battery pack.

Determine Health: Use the voltage, current, temperature, and SOC values to determine the health of the battery pack and each individual battery.

Output Data: Package the data in a CAN-bus message and transmit it at the specified intervals.

Store Log: Save the data to an SD card as a log for later analysis, including a timestamp from the RTC module.

Store Events: Log any significant events, such as low battery voltage or over-temperature conditions, to the SD card with a timestamp from the RTC module.

By storing the configuration information on the SD card and keeping an event log with timestamps, you can easily track the performance and health of the battery pack over time and make any necessary adjustments to the monitoring system.
